# u-connectClient

This repo contains a small footprint AT command client for talking to the following u-blox u-connectXpress short-range modules:

* NORA-W36
* NORA-B26

The client can run on both bare-metal and OS systems using a tiny porting layer (see [Porting and Configuration](#porting-and-configuration))

There are two levels of APIs included in this repo; the lower [uAtClient API](#uatclient-api) and the upper [u-connectXpress API](#u-connectxpress-api).

See the [examples/](examples/README.md) directory for small, working examples that run on Windows, Linux and STM32F4. If you want a Windows desktop example that integrates the
`u-connectClient`, check out the [ucx-windows-app](https://github.com/u-blox/ucx-windows-app)
project which demonstrates using u-connectClient on Windows with a TUI front-end.

**Please note: The code in this repo is in experimental status and changes to the APIs are to be expected.**

## uAtClient API

This API contains an AT client implementation that handles transmission of AT commands, reception and parsing of AT responses and URCs. You will find the uAtClient API in the [inc/](inc) directory.

### Example

```c
#include "u_cx_at_client.h"
#include "u_port.h"

void main(void)
{
  int32_t status;
  static char rxBuf[1024];
  static char urcBuf[1024];

  // Configure AT client with buffers and UART device name
  static uCxAtClientConfig_t config = {
      .pRxBuffer = &rxBuf[0],
      .rxBufferLen = sizeof(rxBuf),
      .pUrcBuffer = &urcBuf[0],
      .urcBufferLen = sizeof(urcBuf),
      .pUartDevName = "UART0"
  };

  // Initialize port layer
  uPortInit();

  uCxAtClient_t client;
  // Initialize AT client (this also starts background RX task if port implements it)
  uCxAtClientInit(&config, &client);

  // Open UART connection
  uCxAtClientOpen(&client, 115200, true);

  // Example of executing AT command without any AT response

  // To execute command without any response use the uCxAtClientExecSimpleCmd(F)
  // uCxAtClientExecSimpleCmdF() uses a format string for the AT command params where
  // each character represent a parameter type (a bit like printf)
  status = uCxAtClientExecSimpleCmdF(&client, "AT+USYUS=", "dd",
                                     115200, 0, U_CX_AT_UTIL_PARAM_LAST);
  printf("'AT+USYUS=' status: %d\n", status);


  // Example of executing AT command with an AT response

  // Execute cmd 'AT+USYUS?
  uCxAtClientCmdBeginF(&client, "AT+USYUS?", "", U_CX_AT_UTIL_PARAM_LAST);

  // Read out the AT response
  int32_t baudrate;
  int32_t flowControl;
  status = uCxAtClientCmdGetRspParamsF(&client, "+USYUS:", NULL, NULL, "dd",
                                       &baudrate, &flowControl, U_CX_AT_UTIL_PARAM_LAST);
  printf("Response params: %d\n", status);

  // All AT client APIs that ends with 'Begin' (such as uCxAtClientCmdBeginF())
  // must be terminated by calling uCxAtClientCmdEnd().
  // This where you'll get the AT command status
  status = uCxAtClientCmdEnd(&client);
  printf("'AT+USYUS?' status: %d, baudrate: %d, flowControl: %d\n", status, baudrate, flowControl);
}
```

## u-connectXpress API

This API is a higher level API that that simplifies communication with new u-connectXpress u-blox modules (see support list at the top of this page).
Using this API eliminates the need of manually sending AT commands to the module.
You will find the u-connectXpress API in the [ucx_api/](ucx_api) directory.

### Example

```c
#include "u_cx_at_client.h"
#include "u_cx.h"
#include "u_cx_system.h"

void main(void)
{
  int32_t status;
  uCxAtClient_t client;
  uCxHandle_t ucxHandle;

  // Initialize port layer
  uPortInit();

  // Configure and initialize AT client (see uAtClient API example for details)
  uCxAtClientInit(&config, &client);

  // Open UART connection
  uCxAtClientOpen(&client, 115200, true);

  // Initialize upper u-connectXpress layer
  uCxInit(&client, &ucxHandle);

  // This will send the "AT+USYUS=" AT command
  status = uCxSystemSetUartSettings2(&ucxHandle, 115200, 0);
  printf("uCxSystemSetUartSettings2(): %d\n", status);

  // This will send the "AT+USYUS?" AT command and parse the AT response params to &settings
  uCxSystemGetUartSettings_t settings;
  status = uCxSystemGetUartSettings(&ucxHandle, &settings);
  printf("uCxSystemGetUartSettings(): %d, baudrate: %d, flow control: %d\n",
         status, settings.baud_rate, settings.flow_control);
}
```

## Building and Testing

The project uses [PyInvoke](https://www.pyinvoke.org/) for build automation. Install it with:

```sh
pip install invoke
```

Once the Codespace is ready, you will see a welcome text with further instructions.

## Porting and Configuration

The porting layer is defined in [ports/u_port.h](ports/u_port.h) and the AT client configuration is in [inc/u_cx_at_config.h](inc/u_cx_at_config.h).

When compiling you can specify:
- `U_CX_PORT_HEADER_FILE` - for port-specific defines (mutexes, time, UART, etc.) included by [ports/u_port.h](ports/u_port.h)
- `U_CX_AT_CONFIG_FILE` - for AT client configuration overrides (timeouts, logging, error codes, etc.) included by [inc/u_cx_at_config.h](inc/u_cx_at_config.h)

For example with GCC: `-DU_CX_PORT_HEADER_FILE=\"my_u_port.h\"` and/or `-DU_CX_AT_CONFIG_FILE=\"my_u_cx_config.h\"`.

### Minimum Porting

Some things are not required for successfully running the AT client (such as U_CX_PORT_PRINTF for logging, U_CX_AT_PORT_ASSERT), but the following are required:

| Function | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| U_CX_PORT_GET_TIME_MS | Must return a 32 bit timestamp in milliseconds.|
| uPortUartOpen()       | Opens a UART device and returns a platform-specific handle. |
| uPortUartRead()       | Reads data from UART with a timeout in millisec. Must return the number of bytes received, 0 if there are no data available within the timeout or negative value on error. |
| uPortUartWrite()      | Writes data to the UART. Must return the number of actual bytes written or negative number on error. |
| uPortUartClose()      | Closes the UART device. |
| uPortBgRxTaskCreate() | **Optional**: Creates a background task/thread to automatically call uCxAtClientHandleRx(). If not implemented, user must call uCxAtClientHandleRx() manually (see no-OS port). |

**Note**: With the new API, you typically don't call `uPortUartOpen()` directly - instead use `uCxAtClientOpen()` which handles UART initialization internally.

For systems running RTOS you will also need to port the mutex API below - for bare-metal systems you can use [ports/os/u_port_no_os.h](ports/os/u_port_no_os.h):

| Define   | Example (Posix) | Description |
| -------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| U_CX_MUTEX_HANDLE            | `pthread_mutex_t`                  | Define this to the mutex type of your system. |
| U_CX_MUTEX_CREATE(mutex)     | `pthread_mutex_init(&mutex, NULL)` | If your system need to call a function before the mutex can be used, then define it here. <br><br>**Note for examples**: <br>The provided examples use mutexes for event signaling between threads/tasks, which requires the mutex to support being unlocked by a different thread/task than the one that locked it. For such use cases, consider using binary semaphores instead of recursive mutexes, and ensure they are initialized to an available/unlocked state. |
| U_CX_MUTEX_DELETE(mutex)     | `pthread_mutex_destroy(&mutex)`    | If your system has a function to de-allocate a mutex, then define it here. |
| U_CX_MUTEX_LOCK(mutex)       | `pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex)`       | Define this to corresponding "lock"/"take" function of your system. No return value is expected (any return value will be ignored). |
| U_CX_MUTEX_TRY_LOCK(mutex, timeoutMs) | `uPortMutexTryLock(&mutex, timeoutMs)`<sup>1</sup> | Define this to a function that tries to lock/take the mutex but with a timeout `timeoutMs` in millisec. Must return 0 if the mutex is successfully taken/locked and can return any negative value on timeout. |
| U_CX_MUTEX_UNLOCK(mutex)     | `pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex)`     | Define this to corresponding "unlock"/"give" function of your system. No return value is expected (any return value will be ignored). |

<sup>1</sup> See [ports/os/u_port_posix.c](ports/os/u_port_posix.c)

### Example Ports

You will find example ports in [ports/](ports/). These ports are used by the [example code](examples/README.md) and you will find more information in [ports/README.md](ports/README.md).

The port layer is split into:
- **OS abstraction** (ports/os/): Mutex, time, and optional background RX task
- **UART abstraction** (ports/uart/): Platform-specific UART I/O

Available ports include:

* **POSIX** (Linux/macOS): pthreads-based with termios UART
* **Windows**: Windows API with COM port support
* **Zephyr RTOS**: Integrated as a Zephyr module
* **FreeRTOS + STM32F4**: ARM Cortex-M4 port (see [ports/extra/stm32f4/README.md](ports/extra/stm32f4/README.md))
* **No-OS**: Bare-metal systems (user-driven RX polling)
